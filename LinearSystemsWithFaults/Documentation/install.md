## Testing the Environment

_Please note that this step is optional_.

The above installation can be checked by running [this]https://github.com/bineet-coderep/Robust_Reach_Set_Computation/blob/master/LinearSystemsWithFaults/EnvironmentTester/test-install.py) python script in `LinearSystemWithFaults/EnvironmentTester/test-install.py`

â€‹	`python test-install.py`

If all the installations were correctly done, then this script should run without any error and display `Environment is Ready` at the end.
